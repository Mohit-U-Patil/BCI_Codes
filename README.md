# BCI_Codes
The repository contains codes used at Cognitive Neuroscience lab, BITS Goa for the proect "Study of motor imagery for multiclass brain system interface with a special focus in the same limb movement". However, in accordance with lab policy, the actual data and some of the scripts are not present online.

The main outermost shell scripts are calculate_result_*** scripts. They follow the functions for which the scripts are self explanatory.
some of the functions make use of the scripts by THE RCSP Matlab Toolbox version 0.1 (This toolbox contains Matlab code to use and explore (Regularized) Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) algorithms for EEG classification and Brain-Computer Interfaces, as described in the following paper: F. Lotte, C.T. Guan, "Regularizing Common Spatial Patterns to Improve BCI Designs: Unified Theory and New Algorithms", IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2010)
